<h1 id="embree-overview">Embree Overview</h1>
<p>Intel® Embree is a collection of high-performance ray tracing kernels, developed at Intel. The target users of Intel® Embree are graphics application engineers who want to improve the performance of their photo-realistic rendering application by leveraging Embree's performance-optimized ray tracing kernels. The kernels are optimized for the latest Intel® processors with support for SSE, AVX, AVX2, and AVX-512 instructions. Intel® Embree supports runtime code selection to choose the traversal and build algorithms that best matches the instruction set of your CPU. We recommend using Intel® Embree through its API to get the highest benefit from future improvements. Intel® Embree is released as Open Source under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license</a>.</p>
<p>Intel® Embree supports applications written with the Intel® SPMD Program Compiler (ISPC, <a href="https://ispc.github.io/" class="uri">https://ispc.github.io/</a>) by also providing an ISPC interface to the core ray tracing algorithms. This makes it possible to write a renderer in ISPC that automatically vectorizes and leverages SSE, AVX, AVX2, and AVX-512 instructions. ISPC also supports runtime code selection, thus ISPC will select the best code path for your application.</p>
<p>Intel® Embree contains algorithms optimized for incoherent workloads (e.g. Monte Carlo ray tracing algorithms) and coherent workloads (e.g. primary visibility and hard shadow rays).</p>
<p>The single-ray traversal kernels of Intel® Embree provide high performance for incoherent workloads and are very easy to integrate into existing rendering applications. Using the stream kernels, even higher performance for incoherent rays is possible, but integration might require significant code changes to the application to use the stream paradigm. In general for coherent workloads, the stream mode with coherent flag set gives the best performance.</p>
<p>Intel® Embree also supports dynamic scenes by implementing high-performance two-level spatial index structure construction algorithms.</p>
<p>In addition to the ray tracing kernels, Intel® Embree provides some <a href="tutorials.html">Embree Tutorials</a> to demonstrate how to use the <a href="api.html">Embree API</a>.</p>

<h2 id="version-history">Version History</h2>
<h3 id="new-features-in-embree-3.5.2">New Features in Embree 3.5.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added EMBREE_ISA_NAMESPACE cmake option that allows to put all Embree API functions inside a user defined namespace.</li>
<li>Added EMBREE_LIBRARY_NAME cmake option that allows to rename the Embree library.</li>
<li>When Embree is compiled as static library, EMBREE_STATIC_LIB has no longer to get defined before including the Embree API headers.</li>
<li>Added CPU frequency_level device configuration to allow an application to specify the frequency level it wants to run on. This forces Embree to not use optimizations that may reduce the CPU frequency below that level. By default Embree is configured to the the AVX-heavy frequency level, thus if the application uses solely non-AVX code, configuring the Embree device with &quot;frequency_level=simd128&quot; may give better performance.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the spatial split builder which caused it to fail for scenes with more than 2^24 geometries.</li>
</ul>

<li>Bugfix in flat mode for hermite curves.</li>
<li>Added EMBREE_CURVE_SELF_INTERSECTION_AVOIDANCE_FACTOR cmake option to control self intersection avoidance for flat curves.</li>
<li>Performance fix when instantiating motion blurred scenes. The application should best use two (or more) time steps for an instance that instantiates a motion blurred scene.</li>
<li>Fixed AVX512 compile issue with GCC 6.1.1.</li>
<li>Fixed performance issue with rtcGetGeometryUserData when used during rendering.</li>
<li>Bugfix in length of derivatives for grid geometry.</li>

<li>Fixed floating point exception in static variable initialization.</li>
<li>Fixed invalid memory access in rtcGetGeometryTransform for non-motion blur instances.</li>
<li>Improved self intersection avoidance for flat curves. Transparency rays with tnear set to previous hit distance do not need curve radius based self intersection avoidance as same hit is calculated again. For this reason self intersection avoidance is now only applied to ray origin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-features-in-embree-3.1.0">New Features in Embree 3.1.0</h3>

<li>Replaced ImageMagick with OpenImageIO in the tutorials.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-features-in-embree-3.0.0">New Features in Embree 3.0.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Switched to a new version of the API which provides improved flexibility but is not backward compatible. Please see &quot;Upgrading from Embree 2 to Embree 3&quot; section of the documentation for upgrade instructions. In particular, we provide a Python script that performs most of the transition work.</li>
<li>User geometries inside an instanced scene and a top-level scene no longer need to handle the instID field of the ray differently. They both just need to copy the context.instID into the ray.instID field.</li>
<li>Support for context filter functions that can be assigned to a ray query.</li>
<li>User geometries can now invoke filter functions using the rtcFilterIntersection and rtcFilterOcclusion calls.</li>
<li>Higher flexibility through specifying build quality per scene and geometry.</li>
<li>Geometry normal uses commonly used right-hand rule from now on.</li>

<li>Improved packet ray tracing performance for coherent rays by 10-60% (requires RTC_INTERSECT_COHERENT flag).</li>
<li>Improved ray tracing performance for incoherent rays on AVX-512 architectures by 5%.</li>
<li>Improved ray tracing performance for streams of incoherent rays by 5-15%.</li>
<li>Fixed tbb_debug.lib linking error under Windows.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="new-features-in-embree-2.16.5">New Features in Embree 2.16.5</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bugfix in the robust triangle intersector that rarely caused NaNs.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in hybrid traversal kernel when BVH leaf was entered with no active rays. This rarely caused crashes when used with instancing.</li>
<li>Fixed bug introduced in Embree 2.16.2 which caused instancing not to work properly when a smaller than the native SIMD width was used in ray packet mode.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in the curve geometry intersector that caused rendering artefacts for Bézier curves with p0=p1 and/or p2=p3.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in the curve geometry intersector that caused hit results with NaNs to be reported.</li>
<li>Fixed masking bug that caused rare cracks in curve geometry.</li>
<li>Enabled support for SSE2 in precompiled binaries again.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-features-in-embree-2.16.4">New Features in Embree 2.16.4</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bugfix in the ribbon intersector for hair primitives. Non-normalized rays caused wrong intersection distance to be reported.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-features-in-embree-2.16.3">New Features in Embree 2.16.3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increased accuracy for handling subdivision surfaces. This fixes cracks when using displacement mapping but reduces performance at irregular vertices.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where subdivision geometry was not properly updated when modifying only the tesselation rate and vertex array.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-features-in-embree-2.16.2">New Features in Embree 2.16.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug that caused NULL intersection context in intersection filter when instancing was used.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where uv's where outside the triangle (or quad) for very small triangles (or quads). In robust mode we improved the uv calculation to avoid that issue, in fast mode we accept that inconsistency for better performance.</li>
<li>Changed UV encoding for non-quad subdivision patches to allow a subpatch UV range of <code>[-0.5,1.5[</code>. Using this new encoding one can use finite differences to calculate derivatives if required. Please adjust your code in case you rely on the old encoding.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-features-in-embree-2.16.1">New Features in Embree 2.16.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Workaround for compile issues with Visual Studio 2017</li>
<li>Fixed bug in subdiv code for static scenes when using tessellation levels larger than 50.</li>
<li>Fixed low performance when adding many geometries to a scene.</li>
<li>Fixed high memory consumption issue when using instances in dynamic scene (by disabling two level builder for user geometries and instances).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-features-in-embree-2.16.0">New Features in Embree 2.16.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved multi-segment motion blur support for scenes with different number of time steps per mesh.</li>
<li>New top level BVH builder that improves build times and BVH quality of two-level BVHs.</li>
<li>Added support to enable only a single ISA. Previously code was always compiled for SSE2.</li>
<li>Improved single ray tracing performance for incoherent rays on AVX-512 architectures by 5-10%.</li>
<li>Improved packet/hybrid ray tracing performance for incoherent rays on AVX-512 architectures by 10-30%.</li>
<li>Improved stream ray tracing performance for coherent rays in structure-of-pointers layout by 40-70%.</li>
<li>BVH builder for compact scenes of triangles and quads needs essentially no temporary memory anymore. This doubles the maximal scene size that can be rendered in compact mode.</li>
<li>Triangles no longer store the geometry normal in fast/default mode which reduces memory consumption by up to 20%.</li>
<li>Compact mode uses BVH4 now consistently which reduces memory consumption by up to 10%.</li>
<li>Reduced memory consumption for small scenes (of 10k-100k primitives) and dynamic scenes.</li>
<li>Improved performance of user geometries and instances through BVH8 support.</li>
<li>The API supports now specifying the geometry ID of a geometry at construction time. This way matching the geometry ID used by Embree and the application is simplified.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would have caused a failure of the BVH builder for dynamic scenes when run on a machine with more then 1000 threads.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could have been triggered when reaching the maximal number of mappings under Linux (<code>vm.max_map_count</code>). This could have happened when creating a large number of small static scenes.</li>
<li>Added huge page support for Windows and MacOSX (experimental).</li>
<li>Added support for Visual Studio 2017.</li>
<li>Removed support for Visual Studio 2012.</li>
<li>Precompiled binaries now require a CPU supporting at least the SSE4.2 ISA.</li>
<li>We no longer provide precompiled binaries for 32-bit on Windows.</li>
<li>Under Windows one now has to use the platform toolset option in CMake to switch to Clang or the Intel® Compiler.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug for subdivision meshes when using the incoherent scene flag.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the line geometry intersection, that caused reporting an invalid line segment intersection with primID -1.</li>
<li>Buffer stride for vertex buffers of different time steps of triangle and quad meshes have to be identical now.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the curve geometry intersection code when passed a perfect cylinder.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-features-in-embree-2.15.0">New Features in Embree 2.15.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>rtcCommitJoin</code> mode that allows thread to join a build operation. When using the internal tasking system this allows Embree to solely use the threads that called <code>rtcCommitJoin</code> to build the scene, while previously also normal worker threads participated in the build. You should no longer use <code>rtcCommit</code> to join a build.</li>
<li>Added <code>rtcDeviceSetErrorFunction2</code> API call, which sets an error callback function which additionally gets passed a user provided pointer (<code>rtcDeviceSetErrorFunction</code> is now deprecated).</li>
<li>Added <code>rtcDeviceSetMemoryMonitorFunction2</code> API call, which sets a memory monitor callback function which additionally get passed a user provided pointer. (<code>rtcDeviceSetMemoryMonitorFunction</code> is now deprecated).</li>
<li>Build performance for hair geometry improved by up to 2×.</li>
<li>Standard BVH build performance increased by 5%.</li>
<li>Added API extension to use internal Morton-code based builder, the standard binned-SAH builder, and the spatial split-based SAH builder.</li>
<li>Added support for BSpline hair and curves. Embree uses either the Bézier or BSpline basis internally, and converts other curves, which requires more memory during rendering. For reduced memory consumption set the <code>EMBREE_NATIVE_SPLINE_BASIS</code> to the basis your application uses (which is set to <code>BEZIER</code> by default).</li>
<li>Setting the number of threads through <code>tbb::taskscheduler_init</code> object on the application side is now working properly.</li>
<li>Windows and Linux releases are build using AVX-512 support.</li>
<li>Implemented hybrid traversal for hair and line segments for improved ray packet performance.</li>
<li>AVX-512 code compiles with Clang 4.0.0</li>
<li>Fixed crash when ray packets were disabled in CMake.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-features-in-embree-2.14.0">New Features in Embree 2.14.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>ignore_config_files</code> option to init flags that allows the application to ignore Embree configuration files.</li>
<li>Face-varying interpolation is now supported for subdivision surfaces.</li>
<li>Up to 16 user vertex buffers are supported for vertex attribute interpolation.</li>
<li>Deprecated <code>rtcSetBoundaryMode</code> function, please use the new <code>rtcSetSubdivisionMode</code> function.</li>
<li>Added <code>RTC_SUBDIV_PIN_BOUNDARY</code> mode for handling boundaries of subdivision meshes.</li>
<li>Added <code>RTC_SUBDIV_PIN_ALL</code> mode to enforce linear interpolation for subdivision meshes.</li>
<li>Optimized object generation performance for dynamic scenes.</li>
<li>Reduced memory consumption when using lots of small dynamic objects.</li>
<li>Fixed bug for subdivision surfaces using low tessellation rates.</li>
<li>Hair geometry now uses a new ribbon intersector that intersects with ray-facing quads. The new intersector also returns the v-coordinate of the hair intersection, and fixes artefacts at junction points between segments, at the cost of a small performance hit.</li>
<li>Added <code>rtcSetBuffer2</code> function, that additionally gets the number of elements of a buffer. In dynamic scenes, this function allows to quickly change buffer sizes, making it possible to change the number of primitives of a mesh or the number of crease features for subdivision surfaces.</li>
<li>Added simple 'viewer_anim' tutorial for rendering key frame animations and 'buildbench' for measuring BVH (re-)build performance for static and dynamic scenes.</li>
<li>Added more AVX-512 optimizations for future architectures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-features-in-embree-2.13.0">New Features in Embree 2.13.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance for compact (but not robust) scenes.</li>
<li>Added robust mode for motion blurred triangles and quads.</li>
<li>Added fast dynamic mode for user geometries.</li>
<li>Up to 20% faster BVH build performance on the second generation Intel® Xeon Phi™ processor codenamed Knights Landing.</li>
<li>Improved quality of the spatial split builder.</li>
<li>Improved performance for coherent streams of ray packets (SOA layout), e.g. for fast primary visibility.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes in tessellation cache, quad-based spatial split builder, etc.</li>
</ul>
